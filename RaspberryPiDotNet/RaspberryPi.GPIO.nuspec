    <description>CPM.CSV contains the CSV parsing code used throughout the CPM application.</description>
    <releaseNotes>This is a unified importer for CSV files.  There were two versions of this code
		in the CPM solution.  The interfaces have been changed to use IoC and reduce dependencies.
	  The Schema Aware importer has been changed.  It now manages the files and the user now
	  only has to update the data rows and headers one at a time.
	    Updated to .Net 4.5.</releaseNotes>
